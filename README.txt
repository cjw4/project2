This is the second JavaScript/AJAX project. The project's goals are:

1) Form Validation
2) JavaScript Calculations
3) Objected Oriented JS implementation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My further goals for this project are as follows:

1) Create a mobile version of this app using CSS/jQuery to create an application that creates a similar Android native application
user interface.
2) Implement the HTML5 JavaScript localStorage or SQL Storage to imitate user sessions and implement client-side storage.
3) Create a manifest file to support offline usage.
